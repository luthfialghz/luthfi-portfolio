- AIDA Model Success: The analysis highlights that Tokopedia's social media campaigns are most effective at the "Interest" stage of the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) model. This means users find the content relevant to their needs, even if it doesn't always lead immediately to a purchase.

- Content Variety: Tokopedia balances "Hard Sell" content (product promotions) with "Soft Sell" content (lifestyle tips, memes, and interactive questions) to maintain high engagement without fatiguing the audience.

- Influencer Impact: The use of "Nakama" (Tokopedia employees) and major brand ambassadors (like K-Pop stars) is a central pillar of their strategy to build trust and massive reach.

- Interactivity vs. Transaction: While Tokopedia is successful at building a community through interactive posts, the conversion from a "follower" to a "buyer" remains a primary challenge that requires constant optimization of promotional links and CTAs (Call to Action).

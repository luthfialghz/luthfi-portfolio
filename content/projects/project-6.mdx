Crypto Swing Analyzer is a sophisticated web-based platform built to empower cryptocurrency traders with real-time, quantitative insights. Born from the need for reliable signal detection in an increasingly volatile and noisy market, this tool utilizes advanced Large Language Models (LLM) like Google Gemini to process complex technical indicators, including H4 and D1 price trends.

The application features a premium dark-themed dashboard with glassmorphism aesthetics, offering users a comprehensive overview of their portfolio performance and market sentiment. With integrated features such as automated daily reports via Discord and specialized entry/exit protocols, Crypto Swing Analyzer bridges the gap between raw market data and actionable trading strategies, ensuring traders can navigate the digital asset landscape with a statistical edge.

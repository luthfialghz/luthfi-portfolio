The article discusses the shifting landscape of Kulon Progo following the establishment of the Yogyakarta International Airport (YIA). It explores the paradox of modernization, where massive infrastructure development intended to bring prosperity often results in a loss of local identity and the "meaningful silence" that once defined the region. The author reflects on how progress can alienate local communities from their own land, transforming a once-quiet agricultural area into a busy, impersonal transit hub.

The main focus of the writing is to critique how modernization often prioritizes economic acceleration over social and spiritual preservation. It highlights the transformation of Kulon Progo’s atmosphere—from a space of communal intimacy and nature to one dominated by concrete and commercial interests. The essay serves as a contemplative piece on what is gained and what is lost when a rural area is thrust into the global spotlight.
